      <description>Let’s face it, creating a custom carousel sucks! I’ve come to be known as “the carousel guy” in our dev team here at JG. At first, it was because whenever we needed to create a custom carousel I was the guy who got stuck with the job, but as time went on it was because I developed a deep love for cool carousels! Now, I want to spread that love of carousels to the ServiceNow Community.</description>
